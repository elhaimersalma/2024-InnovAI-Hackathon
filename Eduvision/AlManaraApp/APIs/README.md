# Dash App Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through the steps to run a Dash app on your local machine. It covers the installation of Python, setting up a virtual environment, installing necessary dependencies, and running the Dash app.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure that Python (version 3.7 or higher) is installed on your system.
- **pip**: Make sure that **pip** (Python's package installer) is also installed. It comes with Python by default, but you can install or upgrade it by running `python -m ensurepip --upgrade`.

### Steps to Set Up and Run the Dash App

### 1. Install Python and pip
If Python is not installed on your system, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Verify the installation of Python and pip:
```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

If you do not have pip installed, you can install it with:
```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for the Dash app.

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On **Windows**:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On **macOS/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

   Your terminal should now show the virtual environment is activated (e.g., `(venv)` at the beginning of the command line).

### 3. Install Dash and pandas
With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies, **Dash** and **pandas**:
```bash
pip install dash pandas
```

### 4. Run the Dash App
Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to the directory containing your Dash app Python file (e.g., `app.py`).

Run the app using:
```bash
python app.py
```

The Dash app should now be running, and you should see output in the terminal indicating the server is running. By default, Dash apps run on `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`. Open your browser and visit this URL to see the app.

### 5. Deactivating the Virtual Environment
When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Notes
- Make sure to always activate the virtual environment before running the Dash app.
- If you need to install additional Python packages, use the `pip install <package>` command while the virtual environment is activated.

Feel free to contribute or raise issues if needed!

### Key Steps Covered:
- Installing Python and pip.
- Creating and activating a virtual environment.
- Installing Dash and pandas in the virtual environment.
- Running the Dash app file (`app.py` or similar).
