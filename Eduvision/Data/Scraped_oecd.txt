Being competitive in a globalised economy requires the local availability ofknowledge and skills. This is why emerging models of regional development emphasise development that is based on unique assets and circumstances of the region as well as the development of knowledge-based industries. Governments naturally look at tertiary education institutions as sources of knowledge and innovation, and drivers of regional development; not always, however, are tertiary institutions well connected to the local economic players. Institutional culture, inadequatefunding, the orientation of public policy, and limited capacity of local and regional agents to get involved with tertiary education or vice-versa are just some of the barriers that prevent stronger links between these different actors. Tapping into the potential for better synergies is a way to advance regional economic interests.
Higher education institutions’ strategic role in supporting regional development can be carried out through:knowledge creationthrough research and technology transfer;knowledge transferthrough education and human resources development andcultural and community development, which can help create the conditions in which innovation thrives.

Key Insights:
Title: Tertiary education institutions, cities and regions share numerous interests
Text: Emerging partnerships between tertiary education institutions and local/regional actors are initially motivated by economic reasons. In the face of declining national public resources, tertiary education institutions are seeking: local support for their global aspirations in research and student recruitment; increased student enrolments from the local population; additional income from services provided to local businesses through consultancy and professional training; as well as the indirect benefits of a local environment that is attractive to creative academics and motivated students.
For city and regional development agencies, tertiary education institutions are regarded as major businesses generating tax and other revenues; as global gateways in terms of marketing and attracting investment in the private sector; as generators of new businesses and sources of advice and expertise including support for existing businesses; as enhancers of local human capital through graduate retention and professional updating of the existing workforce; and as providers of content and audience for local cultural programmes.
Other shared interests exist, too. For tertiary education institutions, regional engagement is a visible sign of their contribution to civil society and the fulfilment of their public service role; and it attests to the value that they add to public investments in tertiary education and research. From a city and regional perspective, these institutions can be key local agencies able to bring together within the territory different national interests in science and technology, industrial performance, education and skills, health, social inclusion and culture.

Title: Tertiary education’s expanded challenges: to create knowledge, to apply knowledge, and to form partnerships with local communities
Text: The contributions that higher education institutions can make to regional development are numerous. A knowledge-based or learning economy requires a large number of graduates and an employment orientation in teaching. It also requires the provision of lifelong learning opportunities for a wide variety of traditional and non-traditional learners. Higher education institutions are now challenged to be involved not only in its traditional role of creation of knowledge, but also in the application of knowledge, often with their local and regional communities. They must, therefore, do more than simply educate – they must engage with industries, with communities and with a wide variety of stakeholders and contribute to the development of knowledge-intensive jobs which will enable graduates to find local employment and remain in their communities. Partnerships with city-regions in particular can be fruitful in three domains: first, matching supply and demand in the local labour market; second, promoting local economic development; and third, contributing to regional systems of governance.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: The policy focus has shifted from reducing regional disparities to increasing local competitiveness in the past decades
Text:Traditionally, territorial development has been geared towards a redistribution of resources to reduce regional disparities. The outcomes of these policies have often been disappointing. Scattered subsidies have become too diluted to sustain economic take-off while more selective redistribution has faced obstacles. Recently, these policies have been overhauled in most countries. The policy focus has shifted during the 1980s from supporting lagging regions and distressed areas to an interest in unlocking the potential for development through improved regional competitiveness. An emphasis on indigenous, ‘’bottom up’’ development has replaced more traditional redistributive policies to concentrate on innovation and competitiveness that is realised particularly through the emergence of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Indigenous development policy focused on the design of new products and the introduction of new manufacturing processes into SMEs, which drove professionals in industry to connect to the existing research base in local tertiary education institutions. These strong links with research-intensive universities provided a fertile environment for innovation with the consequent creation of new industrial districts or the regeneration of older districts outside established urban agglomerations as was the case, for example, of the Silicon Valley in California. In the new policy landscape that resulted from those experiences, tertiary education institutions play an increasingly important role as providers of knowledge, facilitators of cluster development and key actors in regional innovation systems.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Public policy in the 1990s has embraced “industrial clusters” as potential levers of innovation that link technology and industry
Text: The concept of "industrial clusters" gained prominence in the 1990s in the context of shifting policy priorities from redistribution to an emphasis on innovation and competitiveness in individual regions. It evolved from the recognition that innovation is not necessarily a linear process and can involve close interaction between producers and users of knowledge. This became evident in the growing relations established between academics, graduate students, and business in certain so called "learning regions" (areas that capitalized on the value of education, skills, and the tacit knowledge gained through work-based learning to further innovation). One spinoff of those networks were the industrial clusters, strategic alliances of tertiary education institutions, research institutes, and knowledge-intensive business services that bridge institutions and customers, knowledge and applications, technology and industry. The success of clusters, not surprisingly, depends on the flow of talented individuals (e.g. students and graduates), and the creation of vibrant and exciting places.
Tertiary education institutions can play a role in the development of clusters through science-based discovery and new business formation; direct advice to firms to enhance management capabilities; provision of skilled labour; consumption of specialist supplies; knowledge dissemination to related industries down the supply chain; as well as advice on policy and regulation to national and regional agencies.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Current innovation policies place broad demands on tertiary education institutions 
Text: Current innovation policies are now evolving to become even broader in scope than its original focus on high technology and manufacturing. There is increased emphasis on education and training, employability, the quality and skills of the workforce and lifelong learning. People and human resources are being brought into focus. There is a growing recognition of regional variations in unemployment, poverty and exclusion in a multicultural society; and there are also local aspirations to establish creative and enterprising places that attract global talent.
Whereas previous attention was focussed on tertiary education institutions as a source of high technology innovations and new knowledge-based industries, these are now beginning to be regarded in a broader perspective, encompassing the whole social fabric of which tertiary education institutions are part. For example, the new emphasis on social innovation, tourism, the creative industries and welfare widens the academic domain from science and technology and medical faculties to the arts, humanities and social sciences.
In this new innovation policy landscape, tertiary education institutions stand out as potentially important partners because they link up multiple realms of society and strands of activity. More and more aspects of the academic enterprise are thus being perceived as significant to the regeneration and transformation of cities and regions.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: The distribution of tertiary institutions in OECD regions is not designed to meet the challenges of the competitive global economy
Text: The expansion of tertiary education institutions in the 20th century - a response to massive public investment both in research and development as well as tertiary education – has resulted in a highly diversified system that includes traditional research-intensive universities, as well as polytechnics, regional colleges and vocational training institutions, more focused on meeting the demands for new skills in the local market place. The regional role of these institutions has sometimes served to differentiate among the various types of institutions. In Finland and Portugal, for example, universities are considered to have a stronger national and international role while polytechnics are assumed to focus on their regional role. In Switzerland, Universities of Applied Sciences have been designated the regional role.
The distribution of institutions in OECD countries is not necessarily structured to meet the challenge of balanced regional development in a highly competitive global economy. So while disadvantaged regions may possess locally orientated tertiary education institutions such as polytechnics in Finland, community colleges in Canada or universities for applied sciences in the Netherlands, these are often more geared towards upgrading the existing industry and less equipped to build a new knowledge-based economy. This model of public research has been questioned as the new economy demands a more immediate economic return for investment in the science base.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Innovation and development require a closer collaboration between science research and its applications 
Text: In a context of convergence between science policy and a focus on innovation, the institutional division of labour whereby research was carried out in isolation from the context of its application can be perceived as a barrier to development. As a way to overcome this gap, tertiary education institutions are now asked to contribute to economic development by: (i) creating new sectors and spinning out businesses on the back of their research; (ii) attracting and retaining global businesses in the region through the availability of quality research and the supply of well-trained graduates; (iii) assisting with the diversification of established businesses in their production of new products and services; (iv) upgrading existing mature industry through assistance with incremental product/service and the improvement in industrial/business processes.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: The contributions of tertiary education institutions to regional development go beyond the science-industry model
Text: While an emphasis is normally placed on the connections between science, industry, and business as a lever for development, a number of other areas can benefit from the contributions of tertiary education institutions towards regional development. For example, broad-based teaching and learning contributes to the enhancement of human capital. The majority of graduates take up employment in financial, legal and other professional services or businesses. The skills of graduates can be used by regionally based businesses to develop new "products", to trade nationally and internationally, and to serve high-technology needs. Non-scientific graduates are also needed in other areas such as business, marketing, cultural, and tourism, all of which can serve to attract and retain creative talent within the region.
Tertiary education institutions can also make a considerable contribution to public services, particularly health and education, and help reduce social disparities; this should make the region more attractive to investors in the global knowledge economy. Finally, as environmental sustainability moves up the political agenda it is becoming increasingly apparent that tertiary education institutions could have a key role to play in building sustainable communities through research and teaching. All of these latter roles highlight the public service responsibility of tertiary education institutions as distinct from the more private focus of the science-driven model.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Engaging tertiary education in regional development involves a variety of barriers
Text: Active engagement of tertiary education institutions in regional development is constrained by a number of factors, such as the orientation of public policy, inadequate funding and incentives, limits to leadership within tertiary education institutions, as well as the limited capacity of local and regional agents to get involved with tertiary education.
Ministries of Education, for example, tend to set policy priorities at the national level. Even when engagement with business and the community has been recognised as a "duty" of tertiary education institutions, this has remained a "third task" (i.e. a public service role), not explicitly linked to the core functions of research and teaching. This is reflected in the fact that most existing partnerships with the private and public sector are in their early stages and represent mostly bottom-up initiatives with limited support from central governments. Funding for teaching is also weakly oriented towards building human capital in deprived regions and tertiary education’s role in aiding community development is not systematically funded. Monitoring of outcomes is usually not funded either, and related metrics are underdeveloped or inadequate.
Additionally, the governance, leadership and management of tertiary education institutions can also constrain active engagement; senior management teams might be unable to deliver the corporate response expected by regional stakeholders or unable to incorporate modern management and administration systems. Traditional academic values give little weight to engaging with local communities. Current incentive structures are geared towards research output and often fail to encourage institutions and individuals to focus on those kinds of activities, such as consultancy, mentoring and collaboration with small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which may foster regional development. Partnerships may suffer from significant gaps in collaborative relations: academics may be uninterested in tackling seemingly mundane problems and/or failing to deliver solutions on time or to budget while firms may lack sufficient information to track down the appropriate expertise within the tertiary education institutions.
--------------------------------------------------
Policy Options:
Title: Transform each tertiary education institution into an engine for growth
Text: Identifying and supporting regional centres of innovation is a key step in enhancing the role of tertiary education within regional innovation systems. Successful case studies in this direction exist in France, Finland, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom where national governments integrated a regional dimension into public investment in the science base of tertiary education institutions. Other examples illustrate how tertiary education institutions can work together to improve and diversify their supply of services for local and regional firms; this is the case of Öresund University, a network consortium that provides a coordinating link between the community and 14 universities in two countries, Denmark and Sweden, each with different education, labour and administrative systems; a similar type of initiative called Springboard was also created in the Atlantic provinces of Canada.
Another opportunity for action is to look at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It is known that they do not always find it easy to work with large tertiary education institutions or to engage in the wider research issues raised in universities. Creating access points can help smooth this process. Two examples of this type of initiative are the creation of a "Knowledge House" in North East of England, which provides a common entry point to five universities, and Georgia Tech’s experience with 13 regional offices throughout the state.
Tertiary education institutions can also play a key role in bringing global players into a local context in order to attract inward investment. For example, the University Jaume I in Valencia, Spain, is helping to transform the traditional SME-based ceramic tile industry into a global leader. In the United Kingdom, the University of Sunderland participates in an alliance that helps to make Nissan’s new car plant the most productive in Europe. These case studies show that tertiary education is starting to realise the pivotal part it can play in boosting regional and local development.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Develop human capital within regions
Text: Tertiary education can contribute to human capital development in the region through educating a wider range of individuals in the local area, ensuring that they are employable when they leave education, helping local employers by responding to new skills requirements, ensuring that employees go on learning by supporting continuous professional development, and helping attract talent from outside. Widening access to tertiary education is a national as well as a regional task, but the regional dimension is particularly significant in countries with wide disparities. Some countries, for example, Australia, have introduced a specific regional dimension to their tertiary education equity initiatives. Given that one-third of working age adults in the OECD countries have low skills, up-skilling and lifelong learning are particular challenges. In Finland, the Provincial University of Lapland has pooled the expertise of four tertiary education institutions to reach out to remote communities in co-operation with regional stakeholders.
Tertiary education institutions can also improve the balance between labour market supply and demand. This requires labour market intelligence and sustained links with local businesses, communities and authorities. Emerging forms of engagement are programmes oriented to work-based learning and entrepreneurship, which are being increasingly offered by tertiary education institutions. Better coordination of the opportunities for human capital development across tertiary education institutions can be achieved with some government involvement to avoid the duplication of efforts and bottlenecks in labour market needs. Additionally, cooperation among tertiary education institutions can bring numerous benefits including critical mass in competing with other regions, improvement of pathways that involve enrolment at multiple institutions and the sharing of learning through the dissemination of best practices. Other forms of cooperation include joint degrees, programmes, research programmes, strategies and one-stop-shops for industry. Educational opportunities can also be expanded across institutions through the encouragement of distance learning, lifelong learning and e-learning.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Capitalise on tertiary education institutions to promote social, cultural and environmental development of regions
Text: Tertiary education institutions have long regarded service to the community as part of their role, yet this function is often underdeveloped. Few OECD countries have encouraged this type of activity through legislation and incentives, but many institutions have a strong involvement in social services and health that can be turned to community use. The mandatory social service for tertiary education students in Mexico, for example, provides an interesting model for countries seeking to mobilise tertiary education’s potential for the realisation of social goals. The universities in Northeast England are another example: they work with the Strategic Health Authority to address public health issues in the region. And in Central Finland, the Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences is working with various stakeholders to help long-term unemployed people back into work.
In the cultural domain, the contribution made by culture to the quality of life, the attraction of creative talent and the growth of creative industries are all part of regional development. Tertiary education can be a major player in internationalising their regions and making them more diverse and multicultural. High profile initiatives, such as the bids to become European Capitals of Culture have worked in this direction.
Furthermore, environmental development is an area that can benefit from the engagement of tertiary education institutions, for example, by mustering expertise and by demonstrating best practices.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Build leadership capacity for regional engagement
Text: Implementing an agenda for regional development depends in great part on the capacity of a tertiary education institution’s management teams to embrace change and provide leadership for innovation. Senior management teams need to be able to deliver the corporate response expected by regional stakeholders; to utilize modern management and administration systems (e.g. human resources and financial management system); to create transversal mechanisms that link teaching, research and public service and that cut across disciplinary boundaries; to build permanent structures that enhance regional engagement (e.g. regional development offices or Knowledge Houses); to establish sufficient incentives, for example, by making regional engagement a consideration in hiring and reward systems. There is also a need to ensure that units established to link the tertiary education institutions to the region, such as science parks, centres of continuing education and knowledge transfer centres do not act as barriers to the academic heartland. Finally, there is a need to acknowledge that regional engagement can enhance the core missions of teaching and research and that the region can be seen as a laboratory for research projects, a provider of work experience for students and a source of financial resources to enhance the global competitiveness of the institution.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Stimulate cross-representation in governance structures
Text: Tertiary education institutions play an important role in partnering with regional stakeholders. Many OECD countries have strengthened this role through requiring tertiary education governance to include regional representation and encouraging the participation of tertiary education institutions in regional governance structures. Some countries, e.g. the United Kingdom and Finland, have also encouraged closer cooperation between tertiary education institutions in the region (such as joint degrees, research programmes, and one-stop shops for industry collaboration).
Stronger commitment to contributing to regional development can be achieved when tertiary education institutions are mobilised not only in the preparation, but also in the implementation of regional strategies backed up with necessary financial resources. This ensures that they function not only as technical advisers, but also as actors in the process of genuine stakeholders. A crucial step is to create well-functioning, coordinated bodies of key actors at the regional level to adopt a long-term and broad view of regional development that focuses not only on economic growth, but also on social, cultural and environmental development.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Make regional development an explicit priority in tertiary education policy and connect it to other national policies
Text: Tertiary education institutions can play a key role in joining up a wide range of national policies at the regional level. These policies include science and technology, industry, education and skills, health, culture and sport, environmental sustainability and social inclusion. OECD countries that wish to mobilise their tertiary education system in support of regional development need to ensure that tertiary education policies incorporate an explicit regional dimension. Embracing a regional development approach will require tertiary education institutions to translate this engagement in their mission statements and in all the key aspects of their mission: teaching, research and third task activities (i.e. public service).
Countries also need to create favourable conditions for policy implementation, such as greater autonomy that support more entrepreneurial tertiary education institutions and their cooperation with enterprises, and incentive structures like long-term core funding as well as other strategic funding schemes. A supportive system should also include a regulatory and tax environment and accountability regimes that do not place an undue burden on tertiary education institutions and businesses. The search for indicators and benchmarking mechanisms is another challenge to be faced, and has remained a weakness in many countries. Even if measuring is difficult and controversial, engagement policies will not improve without sound evaluation processes.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Encourage the creation of partnerships structured by regional and local authorities
Text: Establish a partnership structure of key stakeholders from local and regional authorities, business, the community and tertiary education to provide a focus for dialogue about tertiary education’s contribution to regional development and to identify and develop leaders within the public and private sectors to populate this partnership structure. The resources of tertiary education institutions should become an integral consideration in the preparation and implementation of regional and urban strategies for economic, social, cultural and environmental development.
Regional and local authorities can further benefit from investing jointly with tertiary education institutions in programmes that promote regional businesses and the community, such as translational research facilities, advisory services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), professional development programmes, graduate retention programmes, and cultural facilities and activities. They can also support tertiary education institutions in bids for national and international resources for programmes that will enhance their regional impact (co-investment/leverage), and ensure that resources provided to tertiary education institutions facilitate regional engagement building capacity on a sustainable (multi-annual) basis rather than being a collection of short term ad hoc projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Title: Nurture institutional adjustments by tertiary education institutions for alignment between their operations and development in the region
Text: The scope and extent of regional engagement of a tertiary education institution are largely dependent on the role the institution chooses for itself. For tertiary education institutions that wish to build such engagement, a host of actions can be carried out that should enhance their impact on the regions. They can start by mapping the regional and external links in terms of teaching, research and third task activities (i.e. public service) individually and collectively and by conducting a self-evaluation of institutional capacity to respond to regional needs. When building an agenda of regional development, they should consider a whole range of opportunities for engagement whether economic, social or cultural and then engage in continuous improvement of these activities and monitoring of results. They should also acknowledge that such engagement can enhance the core missions of teaching and research (e.g. the region as a laboratory, a provider of work experience for students and a provider of financial resources to enhance global competitiveness).
Other actions include: establish a regional development office to mainstream the regional agenda and to scale up the individual case studies to a system; review recruitment, hiring and reward systems to include regional engagement agenda; and establish partnership organisations which link all tertiary education institutions within the region and which are able to undertake substantive collaborative projects and programmes that address regional needs and opportunities.
