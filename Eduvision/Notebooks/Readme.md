**Notebook Descriptions**

This project consists of a series of Jupyter notebooks that document the workflow and analysis conducted during the project. Below is an overview of each notebook and its purpose:

1. **EDA.ipynb**:
   - **Purpose**: This notebook focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the dataset. It includes steps to visualize and understand the structure, distribution, and relationships in the data. It provides key insights and prepares the data for further analysis.
   - **Key Components**:
     - Data cleaning and preparation.
     - Summary statistics and visualizations.
     - Initial observations on variable significance and relationships.

2. **Clustering.ipynb**:
   - **Purpose**: This notebook applies K-means to segment the data into meaningful groups. It is used to identify patterns and categorize regions based on performance and other indicators.
   - **Key Components**:
     - Application of clustering algorithm. 
     - Visualization of cluster distributions.
     - Interpretation of clustering results.

3. **Scraping.ipynb**:
   - **Purpose**: This notebook handles **web scraping** to collect external data related to policies, reports, or other relevant information. The scraped data is then processed and prepared for integration into the analysis pipeline.
   - **Key Components**:
     - Implementation of scraping scripts using Selenium.
     - Cleaning and storing scraped data.
     - Overview of extracted data structure and quality.

4. **AIManara_RAG.ipynb**:
   - **Purpose**: This notebook implements the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for policy recommendations. It allows users to input prompts and receive tailored policy recommendations by combining document retrieval with a generative model.
   - **Key Components**:
     - FAISS-based document retrieval system.
     - Implementation of a generative model (T5) for summarizing and providing recommendations.
     - Interactive user interface and example outputs.

5. **README.md**:
   - **Purpose**: A markdown file that provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and guidelines for running the notebooks. It ensures that the project is well-documented and accessible to new users.
