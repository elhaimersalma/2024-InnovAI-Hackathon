# Almanara: AI-Driven Equity in Moroccan Education

## Abstract
Morocco has been actively adopting regionalized approaches to address disparities in its education system. A key initiative in this effort is the decentralization of educational governance through the establishment of Regional Academies for Education and Training (AREFs). These academies are responsible for implementing national education policies and the strategic vision outlined for 2015â€“2030, enabling educational strategies to be tailored to the specific needs of each region.
Building on this foundation,**Almanara** aims to further address the regional disparities in Moroccan education using AI-driven solutions. Through advanced data analytics, clustering techniques, and the use of large language models (LLMs), it provides policymakers with clear and actionable insights. These tools help identify and address critical challenges, such as grade repetition rates, uneven academic performance, and socio-economic inequalities. By aligning its approach with internationally recognized frameworks like those of the OECD, Almanara aims to deliver meaningful, tailored policy recommendations that can drive sustainable improvements and make a real difference in the education system.

## Background and Problem Statement
Morocco faces significant regional disparities in education, characterized by:
- **Performance gaps**
- **Socio-economic challenges**
- **Low ICT Availability**

Despite substantial investments in education, policymakers struggle to:
- Identify and address region-specific needs effectively.
- Derive actionable insights due to traditional analysis methods lacking scalability and precision.

### The Need
Policymakers lack the tools to analyze trends, forecast challenges, and implement targeted solutions at a regional level.

## Impact and Proposed Solution
### Potential Impact
1. **Improved Regional Equity:** Focuses on equitable distribution of resources and policies across regions.
2. **Empowerment of Stakeholders:** Provides policymakers, educators, and institutions with the tools to implement targeted, data-driven solutions.
3. **Alignment with International Standards:** Ensures that the recommendations follow OECD and international best practices.

### Proposed Solution
1. **Advanced Data Analytics:** 
   - Process data from the PISA2022 assessment program, socio-economic statistics, and student performance metrics.
   - Perform clustering to uncover regional challenges.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   - Integrate insights from OECD policy reports.
3. **LLM-Generated Recommendations:**
   - Generate tailored, region-specific policy recommendations.
4. **User-Friendly Platform:**
   - Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize regional disparities and provide actionable insights.
